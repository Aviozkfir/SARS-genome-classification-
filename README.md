# SARS-genome-classification-
This is an academic final project 

Important notes: 

*In this repository, we have the data results of the project in zip files due github upload limitations. 
The file names are : N_gram3.zip , N_gram4.zip , N_gram5.zip , final_calculations_averaged.zip.

*The Executable for the application located in "Application" folder is CovidAnalyzer.exe.

*The Python code located in the Project solution directory , where "SARS_ANALYZE.py" is the main code where u can run the algorithms with explainations for parmaeters
to be changed . (For exmaple : N_gram = 4 , mode = 0 (full sequence) ,etc..)

*Each app full run exploit CSV file with the value of the N_gram in the "Process" directory and the "post_calc.py" 
can only work with 3 csv files (can be changed in the code itself) meaning you need to make 3 runs with N_grams 3,4,5.


* The Gui application was written in Winform project (C#) but the main algorithms are written in python.
